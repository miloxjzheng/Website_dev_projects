                            <p>Personal information is provided by users when posting comments to articles on
                                Blockzone.com, when registering for a conference, such as Consensus or Construct, when
                                purchasing research on Blockzone.com, or when registering for the Blockzone Career
                                Center. Personal information gathered from posting comments includes e-mail address and

                            <p>Tracking information is automatically collected about all visitors to the Blockzone
                                Sites. This information consists of both individual and aggregated tracking information
                                and is automatically gathered using &#8220;cookies.&#8221; A cookie is a small data
                                file containing information, such as a user&#8217;s login name, that is written to the
                                user&#8217;s hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited. The mobile
                                application used in connection with the Consensus and Construct conferences is operated
                                by a third party, and such third party may use cookies or other tracking technology in
                                connection with operation of the application.</p>

                            <p>We may also employ technology that is commonly referred to as &#8220;action tags&#8221;

                            <p>In addition to the cookies described above, Blockzone, its agents, advertisers and
                                third-party advertising vendors that serve ads onto the Blockzone Sites, and other
                                third party partners, may use their own or third-party cookies or other tracking
                                technologies for advertising, including delivering targeted advertisements and
                                marketing messages (known as Internet-based advertising or “IBA”) based upon the
                                websites you visit, or other purposes. IBA works by showing you advertisements that are
                                based on the type of content you access or read. For example, as you browse our
                                website, one of the cookies placed on your device will be an advertising cookie so we
                                can better understand what sort of pages or content you are interested in. The
                                information collected about your device enables us to group you with other devices that
                                have shown similar interests. We can then display advertising to categories of users
                                that is based on common interests. For more information about IBA, please visit: <a
                                    href="http://www.iab.net/public_policy/behavioral-advertisingprinciples">http://www.iab.net/public_policy/behavioral-advertisingprinciples</a></p>
                            <p>You can control your browser&#8217;s settings regarding cookies by selecting
                                &#8220;Internet Options&#8221; or &#8220;Preferences&#8221; in the menu bar of your
                                browser. This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have
                                your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether.
                                However, because cookies allow you to more easily navigate web sites, you may prefer to
                                leave them turned on. If you are accessing the internet through an alternative method,
                                such as a mobile application or third-party content distribution service, you
                                understand that you may not have the ability to disable cookies, depending on the
                                specific access method.</p>
                            <p>If you want to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, it does not mean that
                                you will no longer receive advertising when you are using our website. It just means
                                that we will not use information collected about you for IBA and that any advertising
                                you see will not be customized or relevant to you. You can exercise your online
                                advertising choices at <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/">http://optout.aboutads.info</a>
                                or by clicking the AdChoices icon in an ad and following the instructions. You may also
                                opt out of receiving interest-based ads from many sites through the Network Advertising
                                Initiative&#8217;s (NAI) Opt Out Tool (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>)
                                and in the EU at <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>.
                                Remember, if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, you
                                may need to opt out again.</p>
                            <p>Mobile devices have an identifier that gives companies the ability to serve targeted ads
                                to a specific mobile device. In many cases, you can turn off mobile device ad tracking
                                or you can reset the advertising identifier at any time within your mobile device
                                privacy settings. Another tool you can use to control advertising on your mobile device
                                is the AppChoices App: <a href="http://youradchoices.com/appchoices">http://youradchoices.com/appchoices</a>.
                                You may also choose to turn off location tracking on your mobile device. If you turn
                                off ad tracking or location tracking, we will no longer use information collected from
                                your device’s advertising identifier for the purposes of advertising. You may still see
                                the same number of ads but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on
                                your interests.</p>
