		<br>
		<p class="main">LAST UPDATED: November 04, 2018</p>
		<p class="main">Token72, together with its affiliates ("Token72", "we", "us") values the privacy of individuals who visit our investment platform, available at <a href="https://token72.com" class="link">https://token72.com</a> or <a href="https://token72.io" class="link">https://token72.io</a> and any of our other websites, applications, or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Service"). The Service allows accredited investors that have created an account with us ("Investors") to make investments in token sales with blockchain companies listed on the Service ("Token Developers"). This Privacy Policy ("Policy") is designed to explain how we collect, use, and share information from users of the Service, including Investors and Token Developers. This Policy is incorporated by reference into our <a href="tofservice.html" class="link">Terms of Service</a>. By agreeing to this Policy in your account setup or by using the Service, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy.</p>

		<p class="main">We collect any information you provide to us when you use the Service. You may provide us with information in various ways on the Service.</p>
		<p class="main">Registration : If you register with us as an Investor, you are required to provide us with your name and email address and to designate a password. In order to participate in token sales as an Investor, we also require certain information to confirm your status as an accredited investor. For example, Investors hoping to participate in a token sale in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of a corporation or trust, must provide their full name, social security number, phone number, address, date of birth, and proof of required assets (such as an asset appraisal) or income (such as tax filings or pay stubs). We also require Investors to complete a short questionnaire regarding their interest in specific types of token sales.</p>
		<p class="main">Token Developers will provide us with information about their project and token offering during the course of our diligence process, certain of which will be provided to potential Investors to assist in making an investment decision.</p>
		<p class="main">Financial Information : Investors may invest in token sales using traditional currency and/or cryptocurrency. To facilitate these transactions we will collect necessary financial information, such as your bank's routing number and your account number.</p>
		<p class="main">Communications : If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you. For example, when you email our Customer Support Team, we will receive your email address, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.</p>
